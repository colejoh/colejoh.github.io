# Radio Show Site

This is a site for my radio show. Unfortunately, I have yet to come up with a name. The purpose of the site is to provide a simple place for listeners to go to listen and learn more about what is being played.

Features include:
- Embeded listen widget
- Current setlist
- Archive of all previous weeks

The site can be seen at http://colejoh.com/radio
